# Overview

The log viewer offers two ways to filter logs by their level.

## Severity-based filtering
You can filter for log events at or above a selected level by clicking the level's name. For
example, selecting INFO shows INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL logs.

## Individual level filtering
You can select specific log levels to show or hide by checking or unchecking the checkbox next to
each level's name.
