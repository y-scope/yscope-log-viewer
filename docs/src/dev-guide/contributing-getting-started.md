# Getting started

Have an issue you want to fix or a feature you'd like to implement? We'd love to see it!

The general process is as follows:

* Submit a [bug report][bug-report] or [feature request][feature-req] describing the motivation for
  the change and your proposed implementation if any. A repo maintainer will give you feedback and
  guidance about how to proceed.
* [Fork][yscope-log-viewer-fork] the repo.
* Refer to [coding guidelines](coding-guidelines/index) to ensure your code adheres to the project's
  standards.
* Implement your change, adding unit/integration tests where possible.
* Refer to [validation](contributing-validation) for steps to validate.
* Apply the [linters](contributing-linting).
* Submit a pull-request for your change. One or more repo developers will review your change.
* Respond to the review(s).
