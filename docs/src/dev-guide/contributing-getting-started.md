The general process is as follows:

* Submit a [bug report][bug-report] or [feature request][feature-req] describing the motivation for
  the change and your proposed implementation if any.
  * A repo maintainer will give you feedback and guidance about how to proceed.
* [Fork][yscope-log-viewer-fork] the repo.
* Refer to the [coding guidelines](coding-guidelines) to ensure your code adheres to the project's
  conventions.
* Implement your change, adding unit/integration tests where possible.
* Validate your change following the [validation](contributing-validation) guide.
* Apply the [linters](contributing-linting).
* Submit a pull-request for your change.
