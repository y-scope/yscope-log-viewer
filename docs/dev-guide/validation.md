# Validation

Currently, there is no automated testing in place. While automation is being considered for future
development, the following tests should be performed manually:

* Verify that the following features work:
  * Changing display themes
  * Changing the number of events per page
  * Navigating to the first/last/next/previous page
  * Loading a log file using the open file dialog and dragging & dropping
  * Copying a link to a log event
  * Changing the log level filter
  * Exporting all logs to a file
  * Toggling tabbed panels in the sidebar
  * Using keyboard shortcuts
* Perform a build and verify that all features are functional
